Internet routers can have many links. They have many options for which direction to forward

1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,540
a received packet. To select which link to forward a packet over, routers today typically

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,850
use an algorithm called Longest Prefix Match.

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,980
In this example a client wants to open a TCP connection to a server on port 80, the typical

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,079
port for web servers. The packets to set up the connection and transfer data take many

5
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:28,140
hops between the client and server. On each hop of each packet, a router decides which

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,289
link to forward the packet over.

7
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,530
How does a router make this decision? It does so through something called a forwarding table,

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,989
shown here on the right. A forwarding table consists of a set of partial IP addresses.

9
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,370
The x’s show that the addresses are partial. The x’s represent wildcards. For example,

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,460
the second entry, reading 171.33.x.x means “any IP address whose first byte is 171

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:57,460
and whose second byte is 33.” This particular entry, for example, includes 171.33.5.245

12
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,739
as well as 171.33.1.1.

13
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:05,360
When a packet arrives, the router checks which forwarding table entry best matches the packet

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,410
and forwards the packet along the link associated with that forwarding table entry. By “best”,

15
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:14,610
I mean most specific. The default route is effectively all wildcards -- it matches every

16
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,550
IP address. If, when a packet arrives, there isn’t a more specific route than the default

17
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,870
route, the router will just use the default one.

18
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,450
Longest prefix match, or LPM, is the algorithm IP routers use to decide how to forward a

19
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,490
packet. Every router has a forwarding table. Entries in this forwarding table have two

20
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,030
parts: a CIDR entry describing a block of addresses, and a next hop for packets that

21
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,370
match that CIDR entry. An address might belong to multiple CIDR entries.

22
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,380
 For example, in this routing table on the right, there are two entries, one for the

23
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:51,380
default route, which has a prefix of length 0, and one for 171.33.0.0/16. By default,

24
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:58,500
all packets will go over link 1. However, if the first 16 bits, two octets, of a packet

25
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,290
destination address matches 171.33, the router will send it over link 5. This is because

26
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,140
a 16 bit prefix is a longer prefix than 0 bits, it’s more specific.

27
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,230
So let’s go back to our earlier example, where we showed a forwarding table with Xs

28
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,300
denoting wildcards. Here’s the router and its forwarding table.

29
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,250
If we represent this forwarding table as CIDR entries, this is what it looks like. Since

30
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,740
in this simple example all of the prefixes are in terms of bytes, all of the prefixes

31
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,129
have length 0, 8, 16, or 24 bits.
