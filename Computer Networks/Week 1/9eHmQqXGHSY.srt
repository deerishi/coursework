0
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,780
In this unit, learned some of the basics about how the Internet works. You learned how applications

1
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,929
like web browsing and Skype work, how an application use the Internet, and the basic structure

2
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:13,070
of the Internet. You learned about some of the fundamental architectural principles of

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:18,670
networking. Perhaps by now you know which one of us is Phil and which one is Nick.

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,800
Now you’ve finished the first unit, you should be very familiar with this picture

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,730
of the 4-layer model of the Internet. You now know that the Internet is broken down

6
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,800
into four distinct layers, what the four layers are, and how they work together. But even

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,399
more importantly than how it works, you hopefully understand why it works this way and why layering

8
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,530
is a good idea in all networks, not just the Internet.

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,940
You’ve now seen that the Internet works by breaking data up into small units called

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,840
packets. When you request a web page, your computer sends some packets to the web server.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,680
The Internet decides how these little pieces of data arrive to the right destination – and

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,780
how the packets the web server responds with, containing the page, make their way to you

13
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,250
correctly as well.

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,449
You‘ve learned how two architectural principles, layering and packets, come together, in the

15
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:07,220
architectural principle of encapsulation. Encapsulation is how one takes layers and

16
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,110
lets them use packets in a clean and simple way, such that each layer’s use of a packet

17
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,280
is independent of the others. We’ll talk about a few more architectural principles

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,850
in later units.

19
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,040
In this unit we studied four main topics

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,049
1. How an application uses the Internet. Phil explained the common way in which a variety

21
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:35,439
of different applications use the Internet, using Skype, BitTorrent and the Web as specific

22
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,310
examples. You learned that most applications want to communicate over a reliable, bi-directional

23
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,619
byte-stream between two or more end points.

24
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:51,619
2. The structure of the Internet. You learnd what the 4-layer model is, and the responsibility

25
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,149
of each layer. You also learned why we use the Internet Protocol or “IP” every time

26
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,450
we send packets across the Internet, and why we call IP the “thin waist” of the Internet.

27
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:09,450
3. The Internet protocol (IP). Because IP is so important, we spent several videos describing

28
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:17,120
what IP does for us, and how it works. So far we’ve focussed on IP version 4, because

29
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,660
it’s the most widely used version of IP today. You’ll learn about IP addresses,

30
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,640
how routers look up IP addresses and so on. Later in the course you’ll learn about the

31
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,380
newer version of IP, IPv6.

32
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,030
4. Basic architectural ideas and principles. You’ve studied three fundamental principles

33
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,390
of networks, all of which are very relevant to our understanding of the Internet. The

34
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:46,160
first is packet switching, which is the simple way in which data is broken down into self-contained

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,000
packets of information that are forwarded hop-by-hop based on the information in the

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,140
packet header. The second is Layering, which we’ve already mentioned. And the third is

37
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,530
encapsulation, which is the process of placing a packet processed at one layer inside the

38
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:08,060
data of the packet below. This helps a clear separation of concerns between how data is

39
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,210
processed at each layer in the hierarchy.

40
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,170
you should now have a good understanding of the basic structure of the Internet and three

41
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,470
basic architectural ideas. You understand how applications like your web browser works,

42
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,720
and how the Internet delivers packets between two computers. You‘d probably heard the

43
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,230
term TCP/IP used before: now you know what TCP is and what IP is, and why they’re related.

44
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,790
At first glance, these might seem like grungy, low-level details. But it turns out that they’re

45
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,680
the bedrock of what the Internet is. Every year, new applications and uses of the Internet

46
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,430
emerge. But all of them use these basic principles you’re learning about, and almost all of

47
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,150
them use TCP/IP. By starting with these fundamentals that have remained amazingly constant, you’ll

48
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,270
learn the knowledge that will continue to be important even as we move on to 5G wireless

49
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,670
networks, Web 3.0, and the Internet of Things.

50
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,790
And that’s part of what’s exciting. The Internet and what it can do is always expanding

51
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,720
and changing. But there are some core ideas and principles which are constant through

52
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,810
all of that evolution. By learning them, you not only know how the Internet and networks

53
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,819
work today, but most likely how they will work in 20 years as well.
