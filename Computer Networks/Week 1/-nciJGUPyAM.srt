Phil: Welcome to the first unit! This is the unit where you get the “big picture,”

1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,580
and a first few details.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,830
Nick :You’re going to learn the basics of how the Internet works. You might even figure

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,480
out which one of us is Phil and which one is Nick. We hope to help you to understand

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,180
*why* the Internet is designed the way it is. What are some of its strengths and weaknesses?

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,680
We’ll also teach you some of the commonly accepted network design principles, such as

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,940
layering, encapsulation, and packet switching. At the end of this unit, you should be able

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,970
to answer questions such as “What is the Internet? What is an Internet Address?”

8
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:37,059
and “How do applications such as the web, Skype, and BitTorrent work?” These principles

9
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:39,729
will help you design better networks in the future.

10
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:43,620
Phil: At the end of the first unit, you should be familiar with something called the “4-layer

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,979
model” of the Internet. It describes how the Internet is broken down into four distinct

12
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:53,469
layers. You’ll learn what layers are and why they’re a basic principle of good network

13
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:57,440
design. You’ll learn what the Internet’s four layers are and how they work together.

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,639
You’ll learn that most applications use a transport layer called the Transmission

15
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:06,220
Control Protocol, or TCP, and how some applications use it.

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,630
You’ll also learn that the Internet works by breaking data up into small units called

17
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,620
packets. For example, when you request a web page, your computer sends some packets to

18
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:20,320
the web server. The Internet decides how these packets of data arrive to the right destination.

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,130
Nick: This unit also examines one layer, called the network layer, in a bit of detail. You

20
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,620
might have heard of IP, the Internet Protocol. It’s the protocol named after the Internet

21
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,550
because it’s the glue that lets the whole thing work. You can change all of the other

22
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,970
layers, but to be using the Internet you need to be using the Internet Protocol at the network

23
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,740
layer. You’ll learn about what the Internet Protocol does and how it does it. You’ll

24
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,640
learn about Internet Protocol addresses and how they’re assigned. You’ll start to

25
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,030
learn how the Internet decides the path a packet should take based on Internet addresses.

26
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,330
Phil: Finally, we’ll show you a few software tools you can use to inspect how your computer

27
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,979
is using the Internet. So you can apply what you’ve learned in this unit to the next

28
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:03,979
time you browse the web!
